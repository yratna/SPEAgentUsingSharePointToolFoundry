## 🎯 Key Insight - Why This Demonstrates Grounding
This response shows **perfect grounding** because:

1. **No Hallucination**: The agent didn't make up fake document names or provide generic SharePoint information
2. **Real Search**: It actually queried the connected SharePoint site and reported what it found
3. **Honest Response**: Instead of guessing, it truthfully reported finding no documents
4. **Actionable Feedback**: Provided next steps if documents should be present

**Without grounding**: "SharePoint typically contains Word documents, PDFs, Excel files..."
**With grounding**: "There are currently no documents available in your SharePoint site"

The agent is connected to real SharePoint data and provides factual, verifiable responses.
